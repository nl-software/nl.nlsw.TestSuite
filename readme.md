# nl.nlsw.TestSuite

The nl.nlsw.TestSuite PowerShell module provides a simple yet effective unit test
framework for testing PowerShell scripts and modules. This 'framework'
consists of just three cmdlets: New-TestSuite, Test-Case, and Write-TestResult.

Should I not use *Pester*, the ubiquitous test and mock framework for
PowerShell? Yes, you probably should. However, if you look for creating
a simple test suite with a minimalistic framework, this module might
be enough.
